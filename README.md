# LaserToMap360

**LaserToMap360** is an Arduino library that uses a VL53L0X laser distance sensor and a stepper motor to perform a full 360¬∞ scan of the surroundings, outputting angle-distance data that can be used for basic spatial mapping or plotting.

## üì¶ Features
- Full 360¬∞ scanning
- Uses real hardware (VL53L0X + 28BYJ-48 stepper motor)
- Outputs raw angle + distance data over Serial
- No extra configuration or setup required

## üîå Wiring

### VL53L0X
| VL53L0X Pin | Arduino Pin |
|------------|-------------|
| VIN        | 5V          |
| GND        | GND         |
| SDA        | A4 (Uno/Nano) |
| SCL        | A5 (Uno/Nano) |

### Stepper Motor (28BYJ-48 + ULN2003)
| Driver IN Pin | Arduino Pin |
|---------------|-------------|
