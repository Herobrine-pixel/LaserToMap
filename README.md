# LaserToMap
LaserToMap360 is a plug-and-play Arduino library for 360Â° environmental scanning using a VL53L0X laser distance sensor and a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor. It outputs real-time angle-distance data for spatial mapping with no extra setup required. Perfect for robotics, mapping, and DIY radar-style visualizations.
